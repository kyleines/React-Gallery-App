# React Gallery App

### Welcome to my React Gallery App for the Team Treehouse: FSJS Techdegree - Unit 7 Project.

By using the search bar or the provided topic links, users can see a gallery of 24 photos that were "fetched" with the Flickr API.

This project was initialized using the Create-React-App Tool and was built in the style of modern SPA's, or single-page applications, to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends. \
This project utilizes some of the best practices of working with React, like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in JS files and managing state with React Hooks in a React function component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.

This app's features include: \
:heavy_check_mark: A search bar \
:heavy_check_mark: Provided topic links \
:heavy_check_mark: Custom styling \
:heavy_check_mark: Custom error pages

Thanks for visiting! \
Feedback, follows, and stars are all appreciated!

### Developer's Notes:
Developers will need to either:
- Create a config.js file in the src/ folder to store their Flickr API Key
```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR KEY HERE";
export default apiKey;
```
- Update the App.js component file with their key stored in a variable under the API commented section.
```javascript
// API Key
const apiKey = "YOUR KEY HERE";
```
The following styles have been changed from the default styles in the index.css stylesheet file:
- The background color to a linear-gradient style.
- Headings text, topic links, search box, and photo tiles all have shadow styling.
- Most text sizes have been increased.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
